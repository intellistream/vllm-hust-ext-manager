# False-effective three-arm harness M1

This directory implements the experiment control plane and a subprocess-based
reference self-test. It does not contain a real vLLM result.

The frozen arms are `vanilla-vllm-entry-points`, `manual-integration`, and
`ecpa`. Formal cells use a three-repetition Latin-square schedule and require
three independent starts per arm. The checked formal matrix is entirely
`planned` because no real service command, model/workload, and process-owned
observer were supplied. Missing metrics remain JSON `null` or empty CSV cells.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 experiments/false_effective/reproduce.py --output /tmp/false-effective
```

The reference helper executes 27 real subprocess lifecycles: three scenarios,
three repetitions, and three arms. Those records are explicitly
`reference-synthetic` and the formal validator rejects them.

`raw-record.schema.json` is a start-level provenance extension beside the
paper's `ecpa-result/v1`: it preserves the arm/status/null conventions while
adding evidence class, measurement source, command lifecycle, and raw
observations. Only validated `formal-real` aggregates may be projected into
paper results.
