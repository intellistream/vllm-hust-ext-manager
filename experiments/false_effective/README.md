# False-effective three-arm harness M1

This directory implements the experiment control plane and a subprocess-based
reference self-test. It does not contain a real vLLM result.

The frozen arms are `vanilla-vllm-entry-points`, `manual-integration`, and
`ecpa`. Formal cells use a three-repetition Latin-square schedule and require
three independent starts per arm. The checked formal matrix is entirely
`planned` because no real service command, model/workload, and process-owned
observer were supplied. Missing metrics remain JSON `null` or empty CSV cells.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 experiments/false_effective/reproduce.py --output /tmp/false-effective
# Or ingest the runner-owned manifest (hand-written JSONL is rejected):
PYTHONPATH=src python3 experiments/false_effective/reproduce.py \
  --records /path/to/formal-record-index.json --output /tmp/formal-result
```

The reference helper executes 45 real subprocess lifecycles: five scenarios
(including compatible and conditional conflict negatives), three repetitions,
and three arms. Those records are explicitly
`reference-synthetic` and the formal validator rejects them.

Executed records are runner-owned: an immutable intake binds evidence class,
identity, scenario/protocol digests, arm, repetition, and order. A runner receipt
binds a canonical record core, final status/cell, exact command and oracle,
exit/timeout, sanitized environment, raw observations, raw stdout/stderr,
scenario, protocol, and intake. Only `artifact_root` and the receipt's own digest
are cycle-excluded, explicitly in the receipt.
The validator reruns JSON Schema and the oracle; relabeling a reference record
as formal, omitting required lifecycle/scenario observations, or changing any
bound artifact fails validation.

The external formal runner exposes dedicated vanilla/manual/ECPA adapter
interfaces with distinct activation contracts. The runner starts the SUT and
trusted observer as different processes and records both argv/PID/start identities.
Only the observer receives `ECPA_OBSERVER_RESULT_FILE`; SUT output cannot become
formal evidence. The runner controls and seals ready/workload/fault/observe/shutdown
phase bounds. It can generate
raw formal records from supplied commands, but the
checked matrix stays planned because no real vLLM commands or frozen non-null
formal identity were supplied. Ready, workload, fault, observer, and shutdown
events are mandatory; startup is launch-to-ready.

`write_formal_manifest` writes canonical JSONL plus an index containing every
runner-owned `record.json` digest. Paper generation accepts only that index,
verifies both representations, validates the complete batch in a temporary
directory, and atomically publishes a new output tree only after success.

`raw-record.schema.json` is a start-level provenance extension beside the
paper's `ecpa-result/v1`: it preserves the arm/status/null conventions while
adding evidence class, measurement source, command lifecycle, and raw
observations. Only validated `formal-real` aggregates may be projected into
paper results.
